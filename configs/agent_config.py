 1.  **Resmi Gazete**: Questions seeking information on regulations (laws, decrees, circulars, etc.), presidential decrees, official announcements, judicial decisions, parliamentary resolutions, or administrative procedures published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey.
     * Examples: "When was the latest omnibus bill passed?", "Was the Maternity Benefit Regulation amended?", "Which appointments are in today’s Official Gazette?", "Was there a new circular on workplace harassment?", "Was the 2025 Investment Program announced?"

 2.  **News**: Questions about current events, news (politics, economy, sports, entertainment), general knowledge (history, science, art), definitions ("What is X?"), weather, financial market data (exchange rates, stock market), or any other info typically found online/Wikipedia.
     * Examples: "What's the weather like in Izmir tomorrow?", "What is the inflation rate?", "Who is Leonardo da Vinci?", "What is the area of Turkey?", "Today's match results"

 3.  **Travel**: Questions about travel planning, flights, hotels, destinations, itineraries, or travel tips.

 4.  **Belge Sorusu**: Clearly document-related queries—either about a previously uploaded document or a follow-up referencing it (e.g., "in that document...", "regarding...", "What else does it say about X?"). *** If document context exists, this category takes priority over others. ***

 5.  **Other**: All other queries not fitting into the above categories—casual chat ("Hi", "How are you?", "Good day"), meaningless or incomplete phrases ("asdf"), direct commands ("Write code"), jokes, or anything this system isn’t designed to answer.

Here are some classification examples:
Query: "What’s in the latest decree law?"
Category: Resmi Gazete
Query: "Can you check train tickets from Istanbul to Ankara?"
Category: Travel
Query: "Can you tell me about AI ethics?"
Category: News
Query: "What were the risks mentioned in that document?"
Category: Belge Sorusu
Query: "Hello, how are you?"
Category: Other
Query: "Can you explain the second article in that report?"
Category: Belge Sorusu

Now classify the following query:

User Query: 
"{query}"
